      <p>Towering above the vibrant city of Rio de Janeiro, Christ the Redeemer (Cristo Redentor) is one of the most recognizable monuments in the world. Standing 30 meters tall atop Mount Corcovado, with arms outstretched over Guanabara Bay, it symbolizes peace, faith, and unity.</p>
      <h2>History & Design</h2>
      <p>The monument was inaugurated in 1931 after nearly a decade of construction. Designed by Brazilian engineer Heitor da Silva Costa and French sculptor Paul Landowski, it was made from reinforced concrete and soapstone. The project was funded primarily through donations from Brazilian Catholics, representing their devotion and cultural pride.</p>
      <h2>Visitor Experience</h2>
      <p>From the base of Mount Corcovado, visitors can take a train through the lush Tijuca National Park, one of the largest urban forests in the world. Upon reaching the top, tourists are rewarded with panoramic views of Rio’s beaches, favelas, and the Sugarloaf Mountain. The experience is particularly magical at sunrise or sunset, when golden light illuminates the statue.</p>

Packages typically include transport, entrance fees, and a bilingual guide. Visitors should bring sunglasses, sunscreen, and water, as the viewing platform can get sunny and crowded.</p>
