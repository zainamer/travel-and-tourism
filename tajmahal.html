      <p>The Taj Mahal stands on the southern bank of the Yamuna River in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India. Commissioned in about 1631 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal, who died in childbirth, it was completed around 1648, though decoration and landscaping continued for years.</p>
      <h2>Architecture & symbolism</h2>
      <p>The mausoleum is built of white Makrana marble, rising on a high plinth, topped by a bulbous double-dome and flanked by four minarets. 
          The four identical façades with large central arches, fine pietra dura (semi-precious stone inlay) work, and Arabic calligraphy form an extraordinary composition.
          The surrounding formal Mughal gardens, water-channels and reflecting pool mirror the building, enhancing its effect. Some legends say that the changing hues of the marble surface — pink at dawn, milky white in the morning, golden at dusk — symbolise the changing moods of love.</p>
      <h2>Construction & history</h2>
      <p>Over 20,000 labourers, artisans, and craftsmen from across India, Persia and even Europe took part. 
          The construction took about 22 years from 1632, though ancillary work carried on. 
          The site on the Yamuna served both as scenic backdrop and symbolic setting (Paradise garden concept). According to UNESCO, the Taj Mahal is “the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world heritage.”</p>

      <h2>Travel Packages & Guides</h2>
      <p>Many travel agencies offer Rio City Tours that combine Christ the Redeemer with other attractions such as Copacabana Beach, Sugarloaf Mountain, and the Selarón Steps.
